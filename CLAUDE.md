# NoetherSolve — AI Agent Instructions

**What this project does:** Discover new science by finding where LLM knowledge ends, running experiments in those gaps, and teaching the results back to the model. Each cycle makes the model smarter than the last.

The core loop: propose candidate → verify numerically → check if the model knows it → if not, that's where new science lives → discover the answer → train an adapter → the model now knows something that wasn't in any training corpus → repeat with a smarter model.

Adapters stack within a run (each discovery compounds) and don't degrade existing knowledge (logit-space, zero MMLU delta). This isn't alignment repair — it's knowledge frontier expansion.

---

## Your First Move — Always

Before doing anything else:

```bash
# 1. See what's already been tried (avoid duplicates)
cat results/candidates.tsv

# 2. See what's currently being hunted
python claim.py list

# 3. See the open questions queue (AI-generated hypotheses + user problems)
python autonomy_loop.py show-queue

# 4. See the current state of all discoveries
python dashboard.py --open
```

Then read `README.md` for the architecture and `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full protocol.

---

## Ask the User First

**At the start of every session, ask:**

> "Do you have an unsolved physics problem you'd like to investigate, or should I
> pick from the open questions queue?"

If the user has their own problem:
```bash
python autonomy_loop.py propose-problem
# (prompts interactively) or:
python autonomy_loop.py propose-problem --text "Your question here"
```
This calls Claude API (adaptive thinking) to:
1. Generate a complete problem YAML with expression templates
2. Suggest a verification facts file to create
3. Add the direction to the open questions queue

If the user wants to pick from the queue:
```bash
python autonomy_loop.py show-queue
# Pick a high-priority expression or direction
# Run: python autonomy_loop.py --problem problems/<relevant>.yaml
```

## The Discovery-Injection Pipeline

Every hypothesis goes through verify → check → discover → teach:

```
Hypothesis (expression)
       │
       ▼
 Numerical checker          ← Is this actually conserved?
 (RK45, frac_var test)        frac_var = σ/|mean| < 5e-3 → PASS
       │ PASS
       ▼
 Oracle filter              ← Does the model already know it?
 (log-prob margin,            margin = log P(truth) − log P(best distractor)
  base LLM + adapter stack)   adapter stack = all prior discoveries this run
       │
       ├─ PASS  → DUAL-PASS (model knows it, archive)
       └─ FAIL  → NEW SCIENCE: model hasn't seen this
                    │
                    ▼
              Train adapter (teach the discovery to the model)
                    │
                    ├─ margin flips → INJECTED: adapter joins stack
                    │                  (model is now smarter for all future candidates)
                    └─ margin stays → HARD GAP: log it, try next run
```

Adapters stack: discovery #1's adapter is active when evaluating candidate #2.
Each successful injection compounds within the run.

After the main sweep, **Phase 2.5 (confidence-driven resampling)** retries
borderline failures (margin between -5 and 0) with the full adapter stack.
Neighboring discoveries often rescue borderline candidates. Survivors get
promoted to high-priority in the open questions queue.

**Diagnostic quadrants:**
| # | Oracle | Checker | Adapter Δ | Action |
|---|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | PASS | PASS | — | Archive, add to verification set |
| 2 | FAIL | PASS | improves | Apply adapter, re-verify |
| 3 | FAIL | PASS | worsens | **Knowledge gap** — train domain adapter |
| 4 | — | FAIL | — | Discard |

---

## Fully Autonomous Run (Recommended)

Once a problem YAML exists, the full loop runs without human babysitting:

```bash
# Full autonomous run — sweeps, oracles, trains adapters, publishes
python autonomy_loop.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml

# Also generate new hypotheses for the next session
python autonomy_loop.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml \
    --generate-problems

# Dry run — just numerical sweep, no model load needed
python autonomy_loop.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml --dry-run

# Oracle without training (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needed)
python autonomy_loop.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml \
    --skip-training
```

The loop does everything: expand templates → check numerically → generate oracle
question via Claude API → run oracle → if fails, generate training data → train
adapter → re-evaluate → publish to candidates.tsv → generate new hypotheses.

**What `--generate-problems` does:**
After the main loop, calls Claude (adaptive thinking) to propose 8-12 new
expression hypotheses based on what was found. These go into
`results/open_questions.jsonl` and are automatically injected into the next run.

## Running an Experiment — Step by Step (Manual)

### Step 1: Claim your hypothesis (prevents duplicate work)
```bash
python claim.py claim \
  --problem vortex_pair_conservation \
  --expr "your expression here" \
  --handle your-name
```
Claims expire after 4 hours. Check `claims.json` to see active claims.

### Step 2: Run the numerical checker
```bash
# Figure-8 3-body
python conservation_checker.py --ic figure8 --expr "s['r12']+s['r13']+s['r23']"
python conservation_checker.py --all   # run all ICs and known candidates

# 2D point-vortex
python vortex_checker.py --ic restricted --expr "s['r12'] + 0.3*(s['r13']+s['r23'])"
python vortex_checker.py --all

# frac_var < 5e-3 → PASS (proceed to oracle)
# frac_var > 5e-3 → FAIL (discard, record in candidates.tsv)
```

### Step 3: Run the oracle (if checker passes)
```bash
# Apple Silicon (MLX)
python oracle_wrapper.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml

# Linux/CUDA (PyTorch — no MLX needed)
python noethersolve_torch.py eval-oracle \
  --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml --diagnose
```

### Step 4: If oracle fails, diagnose and repair
```bash
python oracle_wrapper.py --problem problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml \
    --repair --diagnose
# Prints quadrant: FIXABLE_BIAS (adapter helps) or KNOWLEDGE_GAP (need training data)
```

### Step 5: If knowledge gap, train a domain adapter
```bash
# Apple Silicon (MLX)
python training/scripts/train_vortex_adapter.py --data my_training_data.json --steps 1500

# Linux/CUDA (PyTorch)
python noethersolve_torch.py train-adapter \
  --data my_training_data.json \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Base \
  --out adapters/my_adapter.npz
```

### Step 6: Publish results
Add a row to `results/candidates.tsv` and open a PR. If DUAL-PASS or FLIPPED, add a discovery note to `results/discoveries/`. Remove your entry from `claims.json`.

## Open Questions Queue

The `results/open_questions.jsonl` file accumulates AI-generated hypotheses and
user-proposed research directions across sessions. It's how the system "remembers"
what to try next.

**Check it before starting:**
```bash
python autonomy_loop.py show-queue
```

**Two types of entries:**
- `type: expression` — specific Python expression ready to numerically check
- `type: direction` — broader research question needing a new problem YAML

**Entries are auto-injected** into the next `autonomy_loop.py` run for the
matching domain. You can also manually pick one and run it.

**Marking a question done:**  Edit `results/open_questions.jsonl` and set
`"status": "done"`. Or it's automatically closed when added to candidates.tsv.

---

## Finding Open Problems — Read the Live Sources

**Never rely on static lists in this file — they go stale.** Always query the live sources:

```bash
# What's already been tried? (closed holes — don't duplicate)
cat results/candidates.tsv

# What's actively being hunted right now? (in-flight claims)
python claim.py list

# What's in the open questions queue? (AI-generated + user proposals)
python autonomy_loop.py show-queue

# What's still open in each domain? (suggested next targets from domain experts)
grep -A 20 "Next interesting targets" problems/vortex_pair_conservation.yaml
grep -A 20 "Next interesting targets" problems/3body_conservation.yaml

# Full picture with charts
python dashboard.py --open
```

**Interpreting candidates.tsv to find open work:**
- `ORACLE-FAIL+CHECKER-PASS` with no claim → open gap, good target for adapter repair
- `QUADRANT3→FLIPPED` → closed, but suggests related expressions worth trying
- `CHECKER-FAIL` → dead end, skip entirely
- Rows in `claims.json` with future `expires_at` → someone is working on it, pick something else

**To propose a new domain entirely:**
Copy `problems/problem_template.yaml` and add three files: `my_domain.yaml` + `my_domain_facts.json` + `my_domain_checker.py`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the plugin contract.

---

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not re-test already-closed hypotheses.** Check `candidates.tsv` first. Semantic near-duplicates count (r12+r13+r23 ≡ r13+r12+r23).
- **Do not use the mixed STEM adapter on vortex facts.** It makes vortex margins catastrophically worse (confirmed: -10.6 → -30.5). Use the domain-specific vortex adapter.
- **Do not use the choreography adapter on vortex problems** (wrong domain, cross-domain interference confirmed).
- **Do not naively merge/average adapters across domains.** `multi_domain_v2` (averaged weights of vortex + H-Lz adapters) underperforms both specialists on every benchmark. Adapter averaging degrades specialist performance. If you need multi-domain coverage, use task-vector merging or keep adapters separate and swap them per domain.
- **Do not test equilateral triangle ICs as interesting.** Equilateral = relative equilibrium for ANY circulation values — all rᵢⱼ=const exactly. Trivially conserved, not interesting.
- **Do not use verbose prose in oracle facts.** Compact symbolic notation only: `"Q = r₁₂ + ε(r₁₃+r₂₃) = const"`. Verbose prose fails the oracle (confirmed in pilot runs).
- **Do not hardcode absolute paths** in any script. Use `os.path.dirname(__file__)` for relative resolution.

## Checker Output Interpretation

```
frac_var < 1e-6   → Near-exact conservation (e.g. H, Lz — fundamental laws)
frac_var < 5e-3   → PASS threshold — approximate invariant worth checking oracle
frac_var < 1e-2   → Borderline (record, may be IC-dependent)
frac_var > 1e-2   → FAIL — not conserved on this IC
```

## Oracle Output Interpretation

```
margin > +1.5     → Strong PASS — model confidently knows this
margin  0 to +1.5 → Weak PASS — model leans correct
margin -1 to 0    → Borderline — try adapter repair
margin < -5       → Strong FAIL — likely knowledge gap
margin < -20      → Extreme gap — domain-specific adapter required
```

## Hardware Notes

**Apple Silicon (M-series):**
- Use `oracle_wrapper.py` and `train_*_adapter.py` (MLX backend)
- MLX loads Qwen3-4B-Base in ~1.5s
- Do NOT use PyTorch MPS for training — deadlocks on backward passes

**Linux / NVIDIA GPU:**
- Use `noethersolve_torch.py` (PyTorch backend, no MLX dependency)
- `pip install torch transformers accelerate` then run normally
- CUDA auto-detected; falls back to CPU if no GPU

**Both backends** produce `.npz` adapter files with identical key names (`gate_proj.weight`, `up_proj.weight`, `down_proj.weight`) — adapters are cross-platform.
