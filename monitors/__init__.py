# monitors/ — manual registry of discovered conservation-law monitors
#
# Evolution rule (2026-03-13):
#   New monitors start as individual files here (one file = one discovery).
#   After 3-5 discoveries, common patterns get factored into registry.py.
#   Until then: manual addition = maximum flexibility, stays grounded in real signals.
#
# To add a new monitor:
#   1. Create monitors/your_quantity.py with a compute_* function
#   2. Import it here
#   3. Add one line to MONITORS dict
#   4. Add one line to your problem.yaml under monitors:
#
# Current monitors:
#   margin_sign                    — oracle log-prob margin (always required)
#   sum_pairwise_distances_variance — r12+r13+r23 near-conservation (figure-8 Z3, C01)
#   e2_symmetric_poly_variance      — r12*r13+r12*r23+r13*r23 (figure-8 Z3, C10) ← KNOWLEDGE GAP confirmed
